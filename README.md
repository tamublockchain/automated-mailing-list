# Automated Mailing List

In order to maintain our clubs mailing list, I designed a Python script that takes emails from our google form and preprocesses them into an easy
copy/paste format. Below are directions on how to use 

1. Clone this repository locally and ensure that the mailing list is the same. If not, you will have to change the form ID 
2. Go to the executive drive and grab the token and credientials and copy them into the files 
3. Make sure you have access to the club email 
4. Run the python script and grab the emails from add.txt
